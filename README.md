# CustomItemsGIT
CustomItemsGIT contains all the source code for the Custom Items videos

The codes in this repository includes all the Custom Items coded in the Custom Items series. However, codes from other series will not be uploaded in this repository, such as the Creating Hypixel Skyblock Items series (maybe in the future) and the How to Code a Spigot Plugin Series.

Codes in this repository may be different from the ones in the videos. This might be because either there is a shorter way to code the item as compared to the codes in the videos, or a necessary feature was missed out in the video.

Thank you for your understanding and have a great day! Enjoy Coding!
